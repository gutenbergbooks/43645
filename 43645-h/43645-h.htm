<div class='unindent'><b><big>T</big>AKE</b> care, little girl, that you do not
fall into the water; for if once you fell in,
you could not get out again, unless somebody
happened to come to your assistance.
When you are sent by your mother to fetch
water, you should be careful how you dip
your jug in; and after it is filled, you
should go steadily home, without playing
by the way.</div>

But now, your lambkin by your side<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Takes all your thoughts and all your care;</span><br />

<p>"Turnips, cabbages, carrots, Ho! Now
try, Ma'am; I dare say you and I can
agree upon a price for this bunch of turnips:
they were fresh gathered this morning,
I assure you; and I think if you buy
of me once, you will never buy of any body
else.&mdash;Pray, Ma'am, try my fine, fresh
codlins. They are very cheap, and as
large as you can get any where."</p>

<p>How quiet that cow seems, which Molly
the dairy-maid has just been milking. In
some parts of the world there are wild
cows, and buffaloes too, which will kill
those who attack them, if they can; but in
this happy island, there are no fierce wild
beasts, to frighten us from the fields by
day, or disturb our slumbers by night.</p>

To Brighton or Worthing, and all with full speed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which way are you going so mightily fast?</span><br />
Take care of the reins, for your mettlesome steed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might stumble and lay you too low at the last.</span><br />
<br />
With spurs and with boots you are finely set out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To take a long journey o'er hill and o'er dale;</span><br />
But remember one thing&mdash;'tis of mighty import&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your poney may founder, and all his strength fail.</span><br />
<br />
And you, too, confess, when you weary have been,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the end of your journey, wherever you roam;</span><br />
That, tho' houses, and parks, and fine rivers you've seen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's no place so happy, so sweet as your home.</span><br />

<h2><i>No. 6.&mdash;Man and Woman.</i></h2>


<p>Ah, poor people, how sorry I am for
you! I hope you have not far to go before
you see your nice little cottage. It is dismal
walking in such weather; but as you
are caught in the rain, you must make the
best of your way, and be thankful you
have a home to shelter you.</p>

<h2><i>No. 7.&mdash;The Gravel-pit.</i></h2>


<p>How industriously these men are working.
One is picking down the hard gravel,
with a pick-axe: the other is taking it up
with a shovel, and putting it into a sieve.
All the small pieces go through, and the
great stones remain. The sifted gravel, I
suppose, will be carried in a cart to some
gentleman's garden, to make walks; and the
stones will be used in mending the roads.</p>

<h2><i>No. 8.&mdash;Gardener.</i></h2>


<p>"May I dig a little for you, father? I
am sure I can dig very nicely, if you will
but let me try"&mdash;"And I can pull up the
weeds," said little Jane.&mdash;"You are both
mistaken," replied their father: "you,
John, have not strength to put the spade
far enough into the hard ground; and you,
Jane, would be apt to pull up flowers as
well as weeds: and so you must both be
satisfied to work in your own little gardens
for the present, till the one is stronger,
and the other wiser."</p>

<h2><i>No. 9.&mdash;The Well.</i></h2>


<p>The man who is drawing up water from
the well, appears to have rather hard work.
Wells are very useful things: in them is
collected a great quantity of water, which
can be drawn up by means of a rope and
bucket; and though it is some trouble to
do this, we must be willing to take it, for
the sake of getting such a useful, pleasant
thing as water.</p>

<h2><i>No. 10.&mdash;Little Girl and Ducks.</i></h2>


<p>"Oh you pretty little duck, how I
I should like to nurse you," said Amelia.
"That would be a great unkindness,"
replied her father: "the little duck is
fond of being in the water, and by the side
of its mother; and therefore it would be
quite unhappy in your warm hands. Little
ducks and chickens run to their mother
the moment they hear her call; and little
boys and girls should be obedient to their
kind parents, because they love them affectionately."</p>

<h2><i>No. 11.&mdash;Boys and Ass.</i></h2>


<p>I am glad to see these boys are not teasing
their ass, but, on the contrary, are taking
pleasure in putting a bough on its head,
to keep the flies off. Some boys are very
cruel to poor asses. The dog in this picture
seems to be rather angry at something,
but I cannot think at what; for these good
boys look as if they were kind to him, as
well as to their donkey.</p>

<h2><i>No. 13.&mdash;Chopping Wood.</i></h2>


<p>This man has in his hand a bill, and he
is probably going to cut up the tree for
fire-wood. The little girl seems to be
catching the chips, to carry home to her
mother. What a nice thing it is to see a
little girl employed in helping her father;
which, indeed, all little girls ought to endeavour
to do, because most parents do a
great deal for their children; and some have,
like this man, to work <em>very hard for them</em>.</p>

<h2><i>No. 14.&mdash;Harvest Field.</i></h2>


<p>Oh! what a delightful sight is the harvest-field.
Our great Creator has made the
corn grow, to make nice food for the use of
man. One of these men is cutting down the
corn, and the other is binding it up into a
sheaf; whilst those at a distance are carrying
a waggon-full home, to put into the barn.
They have got a little cask of beer, which
is a necessary refreshment, after having
worked hard in the hot sun.</p>

<h2><i>No. 16.&mdash;Man sowing Corn.</i></h2>


<p>This man is sowing seed, perhaps wheat
or oats. The ground has been prepared by
ploughing and harrowing. That box holds
the seed. After the field is sown, a boy will
be set to keep off the birds, which would
otherwise come and eat up a great deal of it.</p>

sheep feeding in a green meadow, "how
good our Heavenly Father is to all his creatures.
He makes the grass, to serve the
sheep for a soft couch to lie down upon
when they are tired, and to afford them a
pleasant meal when they are hungry."</p>

<h2><i>No. 18.&mdash;Mother and Children.</i></h2>


<p>Some people are rich, and have plenty
of every thing they wish for; whilst others
are poor, and are obliged to be contented
with few things. The rich farmer gives his
poor neighbours leave to pick up the ears
of corn that are scattered about, to make
them a few loaves in the winter. See that
cottager, with a load upon her head: her
eldest girl is helping her; and a chubby
little boy trudges joyfully by her side.</p>

<h2><i>No. 19.&mdash;Errand Cart.</i></h2>


<p>If you have any parcels to send, good
people, pray make haste and overtake this
man, who is called an errand-man. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
makes it his business to carry parcels, for
which you must pay him a small sum.
His dog probably guards his parcels, when
he has occasion to stop at a house and
leave his cart.</p>

<h2><i>No. 20.&mdash;Mill.</i></h2>


<p>Within this mill are two very large stones:
one of them is kept quite quiet, whilst the
other is moved round; and the corn being
put between them, is ground to a powder.
Afterwards, all the coarse parts of the husk
are taken away by means of sifting: this
coarse part is called bran; and the fine
white inside is flour, of which bread is
made.</p>





<h2><i>No. 21.&mdash;Dobbin.</i></h2>


<p>"Whoa, Dobbin!" says a man to his
horse: "if you go further into the pond, I
shall have to follow you, which I shall not
like, with my shoes and stockings on." The
other horse is drinking very quietly. What
a pleasant thing to have a nice pond to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a><br /><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a><br /><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>

men also have got a nice supper at home,
and kind wives and children to welcome
their return.</p>

<p>"Chick, chick, chick, here is some corn
for you, and crumbs of bread and cheese,
which mamma saved for you after dinner.
Now mind, you little things, don't quarrel
about the pieces: if you do, I won't give
you any more."</p>

<h2><i>No. 23.&mdash;Rabbit, Goat, and Hare.</i></h2>


<p>Here are three very pretty animals. The
first is a rabbit, of a kind, gentle disposition.
The second is a goat: he is by nature
wild, and jumps about from crag to crag,
on his native mountains. The third is the
timid hare. I am afraid she is running from
the pursuit of the dog. Ah! what a cruel
thing it is to set dogs to hunt this beautiful
little animal.</p>
